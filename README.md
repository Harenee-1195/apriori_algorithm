# Apriori Algorithm using Python

The Apriori algorithm computes the:
   * Support (Popularity of the association rule)
   * Confidence (Reliability of the association rule) 
   * Lift (strength of association)

Computing the above metrics for large dataset can be handled using Python packages. 

The repository contains a sample dataset and working Python code for arriving at the result.
